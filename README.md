# Tetris-Using-React

I made Tetris using React and its hooks and other properties.
Please require the npm module stack before using the codes.
I am mot able to upload the entire npm module due to the sheer file size, 
but please import them and add the package.json as in my file. Then you can
require React and use its various components.
